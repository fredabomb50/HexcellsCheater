=============================================================*/

Purpose:
  To cheat a puzzle game that took too much of my time to complete legitimately the first time. The hexcells series doesn't stand a chance.

Features:
 -Will brute force a level to gather the necessary pixel data, restart, and complete it with 0 mistakes the second run through.
 -An empty sense of glory for the creator of this tool.
 
Process:
1 - Have any of the 3 hexcells games.
2 - Launch and select any level
3 - Hit "ctrl+alt+b" with the level fully loaded in.
4 - Avoid moving the mouse as the tool works its forceful magic.
5 - Enjoy 100% achievement completion

Side notes:
-The larger the puzzle, the longer the tool will take in the first phase gathering pixels.
***Currently must be ran at 1920x1080 resolution for this to work optimally.**
